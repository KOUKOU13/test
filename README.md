Link for bwCloud application: http://8d0a4397-e8e9-4178-90ab-81a9fe4c1dfd.ma.bw-cloud-instance.org:8000/

> This repository contains a ride and share web application based on a RESTful API with Spring Boot (`api/`) and a single page application with Vue.js v3 (`frontend/`).
> Please refer to the `README.md` files in the respective folders for concrete instructions.

## Quickstart

Assuming all prerequisites are fulfilled, you can follow these instructions to get to know the application:
- Start the API by navigating into its folder and executing `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.
- Start the frontend locally by navigating into the `frontend/` folder and executing `npm run dev`.
- The website should now be available under `http://localhost:5173/`.
- Register a user (with any name). The Email address must be a valid email.
- You can now create and join rides.
